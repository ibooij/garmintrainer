Garmin Trainer can open Garmin TCX files. It will show a summary of the Activity (training) in the TCX file and show the locations of the training on a map.

In the downloads section you can find the first version of Garmin Trainer at http://garmintrainer.googlecode.com/files/garmintrainer-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar.

This is an executable JAR that only works with Java 1.6.

This first version is still quite simple. There is only one way to open tcx files. Just drag them from a file explorer (windows explorer on Windows, Nautilus on Gnome, etc) and drop to anywhere in the Garmin Trainer window. This will open the tcx file and show the resulting values in the window.

> ## Developers ##

Garmin Trainer is programmed in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/). The Scala language is used because I wanted to try out a language other than Java (my main language) while still being able to use some of the libraries that I am used to. So far, the language feels a lot better than using Java.
